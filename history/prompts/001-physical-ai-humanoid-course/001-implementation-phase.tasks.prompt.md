## Prompt

/sp.implement is running…

## Response snapshot

I have successfully completed the implementation of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course overview module. This included:

1. Creating all 5 required content files:
   - index.md - Main landing page with course structure overview
   - physical-ai-intro.md - Introduction to Physical AI concepts
   - embodied-intelligence.md - Embodied intelligence concepts
   - humanoid-robotics-landscape.md - Industry landscape with comparison table of 7 major companies
   - sensor-systems.md - Sensor systems in humanoid robotics

2. All files meet the 1000-1500 word requirement with academic yet accessible content
3. Each file includes 3-5 bolded terms for scannability
4. All content includes explicit connections to future modules (Digital Twins, Sim-to-Real challenges)
5. The humanoid-robotics-landscape.md includes a comprehensive comparison table of 7 major humanoid robotics companies
6. All tasks in the tasks.md file have been completed and marked as [x]

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully implemented the complete course overview module with all required content and features
- 🧪 Tests: null
- 📁 Files: Created 5 comprehensive content files and updated tasks tracking
- 🔁 Next prompts: Final validation and completion of the course overview module
- 🧠 Reflection: The implementation followed the task plan effectively, with all deliverables completed according to specifications
