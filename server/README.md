/sp.specify   Basic Calculator Application in Python

This module defines the specification for building a beginner-friendly calculator application using Python, focused on core programming fundamentals and clean structure.

Target audience: Beginners in Python programming and students learning basic programming logic.

Focus:
- Python syntax and program structure
- Functions for arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- User input handling via CLI
- Basic input validation and error handling
- Clean, readable, beginner-oriented code

Success criteria:
- Generates 5 Python files: main.py, operations.py, utils.py, errors.py, README.md
- Calculator supports:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division (with zero-division handling)
- Program runs in terminal with a simple menu-based interface
- Code is modular and easy to extend

Constraints:
- Simple and beginner-friendly tone
- No external libraries (standard Python only)
- Clear function naming and comments
- No GUI (CLI only)
- Python 3 compatible

Not building:
- GUI calculators (Tkinter, PyQt, web-based)
- Scientific or advanced math functions
- Expression parsing (e.g., "2 + 3 * 4")
- Persistent storage or configuration files
