# Quickstart Guide: Module 1 — ROS2 Foundations for Humanoid Robotics

## Overview
This module introduces students and practitioners to ROS2 foundations with specific focus on humanoid robotics applications. The module consists of 7 markdown files that progressively build understanding of ROS2 concepts.

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Fundamental understanding of robotics concepts
- Access to a system capable of running ROS2 (or cloud-based alternative)

## File Structure
The module creates 7 markdown files in `./textbook/docs/module-1-ros-2/`:

1. **index.md** - Main landing page and module roadmap
2. **ros2-architecture.md** - Core ROS2 architecture concepts
3. **nodes-topics-services-actions.md** - Communication patterns in ROS2
4. **ros2-packages-python.md** - Python package development
5. **launch-files-params.md** - Launch files and parameters
6. **urdf-for-humanoids.md** - URDF modeling for humanoid robots
7. **exercises.md** - Hands-on exercises and integration

## Content Standards
- Each file: 1000-1500 words in academic yet practical tone
- 3-5 bolded terms per 1000 words for scannability
- At least 1 diagram/flow description per file
- At least 1 hands-on exercise per file
- Consistent terminology across all files
- References to upcoming modules (Digital Twin, Isaac Sim) without deep-diving

## Development Workflow
1. Create content following progressive learning journey (P1-P4)
2. Validate technical accuracy against ROS2 documentation
3. Ensure humanoid-specific examples while maintaining general ROS2 principles
4. Include appropriate diagrams and flow descriptions
5. Add cross-references to future modules
6. Verify Docusaurus compatibility
