# Quickstart Guide: Module 2 — Digital Twin & Simulation Foundations

## Overview
This module introduces students and practitioners to Digital Twin and simulation foundations for humanoid robotics using Gazebo and related simulation technologies. The module consists of 5 markdown files that progressively build understanding of Digital Twin principles, Gazebo basics, URDF/SDF conversion, physics simulation, and integration with ROS2 concepts from Module 1.

## Prerequisites
- Module 1: ROS2 Foundations for Humanoid Robotics (core concepts)
- Basic understanding of robotics simulation concepts
- Access to a system capable of running Gazebo (or cloud-based alternative)
- Familiarity with URDF from Module 1

## File Structure
The module creates 5 markdown files in `./textbook/docs/module-2-digital-twin-simulation-foundations/`:

1. **index.md** - Main landing page and module roadmap
2. **gazebo-basics.md** - Gazebo (Ignition) fundamentals for humanoid simulation
3. **urdf-sdf.md** - URDF to SDF conversion and model structuring
4. **physics-simulation.md** - Physics simulation essentials for humanoid behaviors
5. **exercises.md** - Hands-on exercises bridging ROS2 and simulation

## Content Standards
- Each file: 1000-1500 words in academic yet practical tone
- 3-5 bolded terms per 1000 words for scannability
- At least 1 workflow diagram or figure per file
- At least 1 hands-on exercise per file
- Consistent terminology across all files
- References to upcoming modules (Isaac Sim, sim-to-real) without deep-diving

## Development Workflow
1. Create content following progressive learning journey (P1-P4)
2. Validate technical accuracy against Gazebo/Ignition documentation
3. Ensure humanoid-specific examples while maintaining general simulation principles
4. Include appropriate workflow diagrams and figures
5. Add cross-references to Module 1 and future modules
6. Verify Docusaurus compatibility
