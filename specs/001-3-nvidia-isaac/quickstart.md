# Quickstart Guide: Module 3 - NVIDIA Isaac Chapter Content

## Overview
This quickstart guide will help you get started with Module 3, focusing on NVIDIA Isaac SDK and Isaac Sim for humanoid robotics. This module covers SDK architecture, simulation setup, perception, manipulation, and reinforcement learning concepts.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Module 1 (ROS2) and Module 2 (Digital Twin Simulation)
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Access to a computer with NVIDIA GPU (recommended: RTX 2080 or better)
- Familiarity with Python programming

## System Requirements
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or Windows 10/11
- GPU: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (8GB+ VRAM recommended)
- RAM: 16GB or more
- Storage: 20GB free space for Isaac Sim installation

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Isaac Sim
1. Visit [NVIDIA Isaac Sim page](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim) to download
2. Follow the installation guide for your operating system
3. Verify installation by launching Isaac Sim

### 2. Set up Isaac SDK
1. Install Isaac ROS Common repository
2. Set up the development environment
3. Verify SDK functionality with a basic example

### 3. Prepare for Humanoid Robotics
1. Download sample humanoid robot models
2. Configure physics properties
3. Test basic movements in simulation

## Module Structure
The module is divided into 6 sections:

1. **index.md**: Module roadmap and learning objectives
2. **isaac-sdk-overview.md**: Isaac SDK architecture and components
3. **isaac-sim-setup.md**: Isaac Sim installation and basic setup
4. **perception-and-manipulation.md**: Perception and manipulation systems in Isaac
5. **reinforcement-learning.md**: RL concepts with Isaac Sim
6. **exercises.md**: Hands-on exercises for all concepts

## Getting Started with Learning
1. Begin with `index.md` to understand the module structure
2. Follow the sequential order for optimal learning progression
3. Complete hands-on examples as you progress
4. Practice with exercises in `exercises.md`
5. Use internal links to reference related concepts in other modules

## First Exercise
Try running your first Isaac Sim example:
1. Open Isaac Sim
2. Load the Carter robot model
3. Execute a basic movement command
4. Observe the physics simulation

## Next Steps
After completing this module, you'll be ready to explore Module 4 on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, where you'll integrate the Isaac Sim knowledge with advanced AI concepts.
