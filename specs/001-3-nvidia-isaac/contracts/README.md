# Contracts: Module 3 - NVIDIA Isaac Chapter Content

## Overview
This directory contains documentation contracts for the educational content in Module 3. Since this is a documentation/textbook project rather than a software API project, the "contracts" here refer to:

1. Content interface agreements between different sections
2. Cross-module reference standards
3. Terminology consistency agreements
4. Format and structure specifications

## Content Interface Agreements

### Internal Linking Standards
- All cross-references to other modules must use Docusaurus-style relative links
- Exercise references must include difficulty level and estimated completion time
- Concept definitions must be consistent across all files

### Terminology Consistency
- All technical terms must match the project glossary
- Isaac SDK specific terms must follow NVIDIA's official documentation
- Humanoid robotics terminology must align with established robotics literature

### Format Specifications
- All content must be valid Markdown for Docusaurus
- Each file must include appropriate frontmatter for Docusaurus navigation
- Code examples must be properly formatted with syntax highlighting

## Quality Standards
- All content must pass technical review by a robotics engineer
- Mathematical formulations must be verified for accuracy
- All practical examples must be tested and confirmed executable
