# Week 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals and Environment Setup

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure a ROS 2 development environment
- Understand ROS 2 architecture and communication primitives
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages using Python
- Work with nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Launch robot systems using ROS 2 launch files

## Reading Assignments

- Review Module 1: ROS 2 Architecture fundamentals
- Study ROS 2 communication graph and DDS concepts
- Examine ROS 2 package structure and Python development
- Understand launch systems and parameter management

## Hands-On Tasks

### Task 1: Environment Setup
1. Install ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill) on your development machine
2. Set up the ROS 2 workspace structure
3. Configure environment variables and source setup files
4. Verify installation with basic ROS 2 commands

### Task 2: Basic ROS 2 Concepts
1. Create a simple publisher/subscriber pair in Python
2. Implement a basic service/client interaction
3. Experiment with ROS 2 parameters and configuration
4. Practice using ROS 2 tools (ros2 topic, ros2 service, ros2 param)

### Task 3: Package Development
1. Create a new ROS 2 package for a humanoid robot project
2. Define custom message types for robot control
3. Implement launch files for different robot configurations
4. Set up parameter files for robot-specific configurations

## Checkpoint

- Demonstrate a working publisher/subscriber system
- Successfully launch a robot system using your custom launch files
- Show understanding of ROS 2 communication primitives through practical examples
