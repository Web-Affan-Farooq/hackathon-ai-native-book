# Week 3: Digital Twin Development with Gazebo

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Develop physics-based simulations with realistic dynamics
- Integrate sensors and actuators into simulation models
- Create custom Gazebo plugins for robot control
- Validate simulation fidelity against real-world behavior

## Reading Assignments

- Review Module 2: Physics simulation principles
- Study Gazebo world setup and environment creation
- Examine sensor integration and simulation fidelity

## Hands-On Tasks

### Task 1: Gazebo Environment Setup
1. Create a custom Gazebo world with realistic terrain
2. Configure physics engine parameters for humanoid simulation
3. Add lighting and visual elements to the environment
4. Test environment loading and basic simulation behavior

### Task 2: Robot Integration
1. Integrate your URDF robot model with Gazebo physics
2. Add controllers for joint actuation and feedback
3. Configure sensor models (IMU, cameras, LIDAR) in simulation
4. Test robot movement and sensor data in the environment

### Task 3: Simulation Validation
1. Compare simulation dynamics with expected real-world behavior
2. Tune physics parameters for improved fidelity
3. Validate sensor data quality and accuracy
4. Create automated tests for simulation consistency
