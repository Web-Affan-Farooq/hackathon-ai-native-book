# 6-Week Humanoid Robotics Learning Sprint

## Overview

This 6-week guided roadmap provides a structured learning path through the core concepts of humanoid robotics. Each week builds upon the previous, creating a comprehensive understanding of modern robotics systems from foundational concepts to advanced AI integration.

## Learning Progression

The weekly breakdown aligns with the textbook's four main modules:

- **Week 1**: ROS 2 fundamentals and environment setup
- **Week 2**: Simulation basics and URDF modeling
- **Week 3**: Digital twin development with Gazebo
- **Week 4**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim workflows
- **Week 5**: Perception and manipulation systems
- **Week 6**: Voice-Language-Action (VLA) and cognitive planning

## Getting Started

Each week includes:
- Learning objectives
- Reading assignments from the corresponding textbook modules
- Hands-on tasks with practical exercises
- Checkpoints to assess your progress

This structured approach ensures you develop both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in humanoid robotics, preparing you for advanced applications in the field.
