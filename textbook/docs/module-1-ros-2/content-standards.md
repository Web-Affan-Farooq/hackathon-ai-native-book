# Content Standards for ROS2 Foundations Module

## Tone and Style
- Academic yet practical: Balance theoretical understanding with hands-on application
- Clear and accessible: Use instructor-style explanations suitable for students and practitioners
- Professional: Maintain technical accuracy while remaining approachable

## Formatting Requirements
- Each file should be 1000-1500 words in length
- Include 3-5 bolded terms per 1000 words for scannability
- Add at least 1 diagram/flow description per file
- Include at least 1 hands-on exercise per file
- Use proper Markdown formatting for Docusaurus compatibility

## Technical Accuracy
- All ROS2 concepts must be verified against official ROS2 documentation
- Code examples should be Python-based and runnable with educational focus
- URDF examples must be structurally valid
- All claims must be cross-verified with authoritative sources

## Terminology Consistency
- Use official ROS2 terminology as defined in ROS2 documentation
- Maintain consistent naming for concepts across all files
- Humanoid-specific examples should clearly relate to bipedal robot systems

## Cross-Module References
- Include brief references to upcoming modules (Digital Twin, Isaac Sim) without deep-diving
- Maintain focus on current module objectives
- Connect concepts to future learning without spoiling later content

## Educational Focus
- Each concept should connect to practical examples relevant to humanoid robotics
- Exercises should reinforce theoretical understanding with practical application
- Content should build progressively from foundational to advanced concepts
