# Module 1: ROS2 Foundations for Humanoid Robotics

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module provides the essential foundation for working with ROS2 in the context of humanoid robotics systems. You'll learn core ROS2 concepts with specific applications to humanoid robot development, preparing you for advanced modules on simulation, digital twins, and advanced robotics applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamental architecture of ROS2 and its application to humanoid robotics
- Create and structure ROS2 packages using Python with humanoid-specific examples
- Develop launch files for coordinating complex humanoid robot systems
- Model humanoid robots using URDF with appropriate joint configurations
- Apply ROS2 concepts through hands-on exercises that prepare you for simulation modules

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:

1. **[ROS2 Architecture Fundamentals](./ros2-architecture.md)** - Core concepts of nodes, topics, services, and actions with humanoid applications
2. **[ROS2 Python Package Development](./ros2-packages-python.md)** - Creating structured packages for humanoid robot applications
3. **[Launch Files and Parameters](./launch-files-params.md)** - Managing complex system startup and configuration for humanoid systems
4. **[URDF Modeling for Humanoids](./urdf-for-humanoids.md)** - Creating robot descriptions specifically tailored for humanoid robots
5. **[Hands-on Exercises](./exercises.md)** - Integrated exercises combining all concepts learned

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Fundamental understanding of robotics concepts
- Access to a system capable of running ROS2 (or cloud-based alternative)

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you will be prepared for:

- **Module 2**: Digital Twin Implementation
- **Module 3**: NVIDIA Isaac Simulation Framework
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Policies

These modules will build upon the ROS2 foundations you establish here, diving deeper into simulation, control, and advanced robotics applications.
