# Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

Welcome to your journey into the world of **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**! This course is designed to bridge the gap between intelligent software systems and the physical robots that bring them to life. Throughout this course, you will learn how AI can control humanoid robots, understand their sensors, plan actions, and interact with the physical world.

## What This Documentation Contains

This set of documents is your **comprehensive guide** for learning and practicing all the essential concepts of Physical AI. Here’s what you will find:

- **Course Overview**  
  Learn about the fundamentals of Physical AI, embodied intelligence, humanoid robotics, and sensor systems.

- **Modules**  
  Structured learning paths that cover:
  1. **ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)** – Architecture, nodes, topics, services, Python integration, and URDF for humanoids.
  2. **Digital Twin & Simulation** – Using Gazebo, URDF/SDF models, and physics simulation to replicate real-world robots virtually.
  3. **NVIDIA Isaac** – Overview of Isaac SDK, Isaac Sim setup, perception, manipulation, and reinforcement learning.
  4. **VLA (Voice-to-Action & Cognitive Planning)** – Implementing voice-controlled AI and intelligent planning strategies.

- **Weekly Breakdown**  
  A structured timeline to guide your learning week by week.

- **Assessments**  
  Hands-on projects including ROS2-based projects and a capstone project to test your skills.

- **Hardware Requirements**  
  Recommendations for workstations and edge AI kits to support your learning and projects.

- **Capstone Project**  
  Step-by-step guide to building a complete humanoid robotics system from architecture to perception, manipulation, and integration.

- **Glossary**  
  Definitions of key robotics and AI terms to strengthen your understanding.

## How to Use These Docs

1. Start with **Course Overview** to get a conceptual foundation.  
2. Follow the **Modules** sequentially as they build on each other.  
3. Use **Weekly Breakdown** to pace your learning.  
4. Complete **Assessments** and the **Capstone Project** to apply your knowledge practically.  
5. Refer to **Hardware Requirements** and **Glossary** whenever needed.

This documentation is designed to be **hands-on and practical**. Make sure to explore exercises, experiment with code, and fully engage with the projects. By the end of this course, you will be confident in building and programming humanoid robots powered by AI.
