# AI Terms

This section provides concise definitions for key artificial intelligence concepts, organized alphabetically.

## A

**Actors (in Reinforcement Learning)** - The agents that interact with an environment in reinforcement learning. Actors select actions based on their policy to maximize cumulative rewards. In robotics, the actor might be the robot itself making movement decisions.

## D

**Deep Learning (DL)** - A subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers. Deep learning models automatically learn hierarchical feature representations from data, enabling complex pattern recognition and decision-making.

## E

**Embeddings** - Numerical representations of categorical data in a continuous vector space. Embeddings capture semantic relationships between items, allowing similar concepts to have similar vector representations. Commonly used for text, images, and other discrete data.

## I

**Inference** - The process of using a trained machine learning model to make predictions on new data. During inference, the model applies learned parameters to input data without updating weights. In robotics, inference enables real-time decision-making from sensor inputs.

## M

**Machine Learning (ML)** - A field of AI focused on algorithms that learn patterns from data. ML systems improve performance on tasks through experience rather than explicit programming. Includes supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches.

## O

**Optimization Concepts** - Methods for finding the best solution according to some criterion. In AI, optimization algorithms adjust model parameters to minimize loss functions. Key concepts include gradient descent, learning rate, convergence, and local vs. global optima.

## R

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** - A machine learning paradigm where agents learn optimal behavior through interaction with an environment. Agents receive rewards/penalties for actions and learn policies to maximize cumulative rewards over time.

## T

**Training** - The process of adjusting machine learning model parameters using data to improve performance on a task. During training, models learn patterns from labeled or unlabeled examples through optimization algorithms.

**Transformers** - A neural network architecture based on self-attention mechanisms. Transformers excel at processing sequential data and have revolutionized natural language processing. They enable models to focus on relevant parts of input when making predictions.

## V

**VLA (Vision-Language-Action)** - Integrated AI systems that combine visual perception, language understanding, and physical action. VLA models process visual and linguistic inputs to generate robotic actions, enabling natural human-robot interaction.

## D (continued)

**Dataset Terms** - Key concepts in data management for AI:
- **Training set**: Data used to train the model
- **Validation set**: Data used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting
- **Test set**: Data used to evaluate final model performance
- **Batch size**: Number of samples processed together in one training iteration
- **Epoch**: One complete pass through the entire training dataset

## L

**Loss Function** - A mathematical function that measures how well a model's predictions match the true targets. The loss function guides model training by providing a metric to minimize during optimization.
