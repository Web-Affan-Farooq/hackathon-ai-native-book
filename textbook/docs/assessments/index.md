# Assessments Overview

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assessments section, students will be able to:
- Understand the structure and requirements of each project assessment
- Identify prerequisites needed for each assessment
- Apply knowledge from previous modules to complete practical projects
- Demonstrate proficiency in humanoid robotics concepts through hands-on implementation

## Assessment Structure

This section contains two major project assessments that build upon the knowledge gained in previous modules:

1. **ROS2 Project Assessment** - Focuses on ROS2 fundamentals and robot control systems
2. **Capstone Project Assessment** - Integrates all concepts from the entire course

Each assessment is designed to progressively build your skills in humanoid robotics, from foundational ROS2 concepts to advanced integration of simulation, perception, and control systems.

## Prerequisites

Before starting these assessments, students should have:
- Completed all previous modules (ROS2, Digital Twin, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA)
- Completed the weekly breakdown exercises
- Basic understanding of Linux command line and Python programming
- Access to a suitable development environment (physical or virtual)

## Assessment Guidelines

### Submission Requirements
- All code must be properly documented and commented
- Projects must include a brief written report explaining design decisions
- All deliverables must be submitted in the specified format
- Projects should demonstrate clear understanding of the underlying concepts

### Grading Rubric

| Component | Weight | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Technical Implementation | 40% | Correctness and functionality of code |
| Conceptual Understanding | 30% | Demonstration of theoretical knowledge |
| Documentation | 20% | Code comments, explanations, and reports |
| Innovation | 10% | Creative solutions and additional features |

### Support Resources

Students are encouraged to use the following resources when completing assessments:
- Previous modules and their hands-on exercises
- Official ROS2 documentation
- NVIDIA Isaac documentation
- Community forums and peer collaboration

## Getting Started

1. Begin with the ROS2 Project Assessment to solidify foundational concepts
2. Progress to the Capstone Project only after completing all prerequisites
3. Use the weekly breakdown schedule to pace your work appropriately
4. Seek help early if encountering difficulties with fundamental concepts

## Next Steps

- [ROS2 Project Assessment](./ros2-project.md) - Begin with the foundational ROS2 project
- [Capstone Project Assessment](./capstone-project.md) - Complete the integrated capstone project
