# Hardware Requirements

This chapter outlines the essential hardware requirements for successfully completing the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course. The course involves several complex simulation and development environments including ROS2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, Reinforcement Learning frameworks, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

## Overview

Different aspects of the course have varying hardware demands. This guide will help you understand:

- **Minimum requirements** for basic functionality
- **Recommended specifications** for smooth development
- **Budget-conscious alternatives** for students with constraints
- **Specialized hardware** for deployment and real-world applications

## Sections

- [Workstation Requirements](./workstation.md) - Detailed specifications for development machines
- [Edge AI Kit](./edge-ai-kit.md) - Hardware for deployment and robotics applications

## Key Considerations

When selecting hardware for this course, consider the following factors:

- **Simulation Performance**: Physics simulations in Gazebo and Isaac Sim are computationally intensive
- **GPU Acceleration**: Critical for both simulation rendering and machine learning workloads
- **Memory Requirements**: Large models and complex environments require substantial RAM
- **Storage Needs**: Multiple simulation environments and datasets require significant disk space
- **Connectivity**: For real hardware integration and deployment scenarios

## Getting Started

Start with the [Workstation Requirements](./workstation.md) section to understand the computer specifications needed for development, then proceed to [Edge AI Kit](./edge-ai-kit.md) for deployment hardware considerations.
